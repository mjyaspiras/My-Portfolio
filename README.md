## Project setup
```
npm install - This command installs all dependencies in the package.json. It is installed for Vue.js, Bootstrap, Vue Router, among others that the project will be based upon. They download into the node_modules folder so that the project may be made use of during development.
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve - This command starts a local development server using Vue CLI. It provides hot-reloading, meaning any changes you make in the code will automatically update in the browser without needing to refresh the page. This greatly speeds up the development process by providing immediate feedback on changes.
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build - This command bundles and minifies the code for production. It optimizes the application by removing unnecessary code and shrinking the size of CSS, JavaScript, and other assets to ensure faster load times when the app is deployed. The output is placed in a dist/ folder, which can be deployed to a server.
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint - Linting is the process of analyzing code for potential errors or style inconsistencies. This command checks your code against predefined rules (e.g., ESLint rules) and identifies issues. It can also automatically fix some common issues like code formatting, helping maintain code quality and consistency across the project.
```

### Customize configuration - This refers to Vue CLIâ€™s configuration system, where you can customize various aspects of the project like webpack settings, environment variables, and more. The Configuration Reference provides detailed information on how to override default settings and fine-tune your project to specific needs, like modifying the build process or adding plugins.
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
